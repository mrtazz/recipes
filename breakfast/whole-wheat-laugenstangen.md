## Ingredients (for about 6 Laugenstangen)

- 500 gr  whole wheat flour
- 150 ml  water
- 140 ml  milk
- 75 gr   butter (or margarine)
- 20 gr   dry yeast
- 1 tsp   salt
- 1.5 ltr water
- 3 tbsp  baking soda

## Preparation
Mix flour, salt and yeast in a bowl. Heat up 140 ml water, melt the butter
in it, turn off the heat and add the cold milk. Now pour it into the bowl and
knead it into a soft dough, err on the wetter side while you're mixing it.
Cover the bowl and let the dough rise in a dark and warm place for at least 45
minutes (never hurts to let it rise longer).

Divide the dough into 6 equally sized pieces and roll them out flat. Then roll
them up into the well known Laugenstangen shape. Heat up 1.5 ltrs of water in
a pot. It should be big enough that the Laugenstangen can float and sink
freely in there. Melt the butter in it and add the baking soda (be careful it
creates a bunch of foam when added to the water). Now add the Laugenstangen
into the pot (one by one or as many comfortably fit in there at a time) and
let them swim in there for 20 seconds, turning them around a bit so the base
can get to all parts equally. When you do this with non whole wheat flour, the
Laugenstangen will sink to the bottom and float to the surface again after a
couple of seconds. You can take them out as soon as they are at the surface
again. The whole wheat ones mostly just float for me. Use a spatula with holes
to get them out so you don't bring a ton of water with you and place them on a
baking tray which is covered in a baking sheet. Make 2 little cuts into the
top of the Laugenstangen with scissors or a knife.

Now put the tray in the oven and let it bake for about 25 minutes at 200
degrees Celsius. They should be done when they get the significant darker
color on the surface.
