## Ingredients

- 250 gr whole wheat flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 2 grated carrots
- 150 gr apple sauce
- 1tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk

## Preparation
Mix all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk until it all comes together. It's
ok if there are some lumps and the dough should be fairly wet. Pour it all in
a bread loaf pan and preheat the oven to 200C (~400F). Bake the bread for an
hour.

## Variations
This is an adaptation of [this vegan banana bread recipe][1], so it also works
great with bananas instead of carrots. For a slight vanilla flavour use
vanilla almond milk.
