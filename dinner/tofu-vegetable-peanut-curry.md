* 100 ml Vegetable broil
* 1/2 a coffee mug of rice

## Details
Give the rice into a pot and cover it with salt water. Keep it boiling and
check every now and then that it's still covered in water. It should take
about 45 minutes until the rice is done.

Cut the broccoli, carrot and peppers in small chunks. It really depends on
what size you like but don't make them too big. Also cut the onion, spring
onions and garlic and put it in a pan all together and let it fry.

Put the vegetable broil into a smaller pot and let it boil. Cut the peanuts
into little chunks and give it into the boiling broil together with the peanut
butter, coconut milk and curry paste. Stir it until it's a homogenous sauce
and let it boil on a small flame for about 10 minutes.

Cut the tofu into cubes and put into the pan with the vegtables. Let it fry
until the tofu is golden brown.

Put the vegetables and rice into a bowl and put some curry peanut sauce on top.
